                        MetaboAnalyst now supports the upload of <a href="https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acs.analchem.8b04310" target="_blank">mzTab files</a> in the Statistical Analysis module.
                        MetaboAnalyst parses both the Metadata Table (MTD) and the Small Molecule Table (SML) to a MetaboAnalyst ready data table format. From the SML, users 
                        can either choose to have their features named using the "chemical_name" or "theoretical_neutral_mass". If too many of these are missing however,
                        the features will be named with the "SML_ID". Further, if there are duplicate names, the "SML_ID" will be appended to the end of the selected feature identifier. 
                        From the MTD, "study_variable" labeled "Blank" will be excluded from the final data table. 
                        Note that MetaboAnalyst supports only mzTab-M 2.0 files that have been validated to ensure that the files can be read by our software.

                        The peak list data is composed of peak list files organized into separate folders named by their class labels.  
                        For example, if your data contains three groups, the peak list files should be organized into three folders accordingly.
                        Compress these folders into a single zip file then upload them to MetaboAnalyst.

                        NMR peak list files should contain two comma separated columns with the 1st column for peak 
                        positions (ppm) and the 2nd column for peak intensities; MS peak list files can be in either two-column (mass and intensities) 
                        or three-column format (mass, retention time and intensities), but not a mixture of both. The first line of each peak list file is reserved for 
                        column labels. The file must be saved in comma separated values (.csv) format.

                        <b>Version 2 Peak Lists:</b> With Version 2 of the MS Peaks to Pathways module, 
                        retention time can be included as a new column with the "rt" or "r.t" heading. 
                        The maximum number of columns that can be uploaded is now 5: "m.z", "r.t", "p.value", "t.score" and "mode".

                    <p>
                        If p-values have not yet been calculated for their data, users can use the exploratory statistical analysis module
                        to upload their raw peak tables, process the data, perform t-tests or fold-change analysis, and then upload these 
                        results into the module. An example dataset is shown below:

                    <h3>Peak table format</h3>

                    <p>
                        Upload your data in either a tab-deliminted (.txt) or comma-separated (.csv) format. The MS Peaks to Pathways module accepts
                        either a generic peak table or the MZmine formatted peak table. For <b>Version 2</b>, retention times can be included in the 
                        generic peak table and should be formatted so that the peak and retention time are separated by two underscores. An example of the 
                        generic peak table with retention time is shown below:
                    </p>

                        Metabolite or gene list data: a list of metabolite or gene IDs with optional fold-changes. Each feature should be in 
                        in a row. Please refer to the example data for further details.

                    <h3>Metabolite/Gene list labels</h3>
                    <p>
                        It is critical for your data to be properly labeled so they can be uploaded into the Joint Pathway Analysis or Network Explorer module. 
                        The following common metabolite and gene IDs are supported:
                        <OL>
                            <li>
                                Metabolite list: Common compound names, HMDB IDs, or KEGG compound IDs as metabolite identifiers. 
                            </li>
                            <li> 
                                Genelist: Entrez IDs, Ensembl Gene IDs, official gene symbols, or KEGG orthologs (KOs) are currently supported. 
                            </li>
